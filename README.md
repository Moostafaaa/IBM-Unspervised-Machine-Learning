## unsupervised learning techniques

In this repo, you will discover how unsupervised learning techniques uncover hidden patterns in data without using labeled responses. You’ll describe clustering concepts and apply K-Means to real-world customer segmentation tasks. 

You’ll also compare DBSCAN and HDBSCAN models to identify dense clusters in spatial data. Moving beyond clustering, you’ll explore dimensionality reduction as a tool for simplifying high-dimensional datasets. You’ll apply PCA to uncover key components and use advanced techniques like t-SNE and UMAP to visualize data structure.
